# Quality of Life Explorer v4

A dashboard for community data and health. See our [demo site](http://mcmap.org/qol-dev). This site is made with Svelte, Tailwind CSS, Maplibre GL, and Vite.


## Get Started

This project requires [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org).

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/tobinbradley/quality-of-life-dashboard.git dashboard
cd dashboard
npm install
npm run prebuild
npm run dev
```

The Dashboard should launch in your default web browser with a live reload server. To build the site for production, run `npm run build` and copy the `dist` folder contents to your web server.
