## Area
Total land area

### Why is this important?
Land area is a profile variable that is used in calculating many of the other variables in the Quality of Life Explorer. The 462 **Neighborhood Profile Areas** (NPAs) that comprise the county are of unequal sizes. In order to compare NPAs on a map, the variables must be normalized to account for these differences in size. For example, all other factors being equal, a larger area will have more people than a smaller area. To normalize the population for comparison across NPAs, we divide the total count of population in an NPA by the land area of the NPA, yielding population density, or people per acre.

### About the Data
Land area is calculated by the U.S. Census Bureau for census block groups and aggregated to **Neighborhood Profile Areas** (NPAs). NPAs are comprised of between one and eight Census block groups. 

Block groups are delineated by the U.S. Census Bureau to contain populations between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum size of 1,500 people. Block groups are the smallest geographical unit of the Census for which reliable data is available.
