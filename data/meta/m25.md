## Residential Solid Waste Diversion
Percentage of residential solid waste diverted from landfills through recycling and yard waste processing

### Why is this important?
Residential solid waste includes garbage, recycled items, yard waste and non-recyclable bulky items. All waste that is not recycled or composted is buried in a landfill, requiring large amounts of land and producing greenhouse gases as garbage decomposes. Diverting solid waste from landfills saves money for families and communities, saves energy and water, reduces air and water pollution, and conserves natural resources. Solid waste diversion can be increased by increasing recycling participation and separating yard waste from garbage.

#### How are we doing?
The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that 75% of solid waste is recyclable. Households in the City of Charlotte diverted just under 26% of solid waste from the landfill in 2021, down from nearly 36% since 2013. 

#### Did you know?
More than 100,000 tons of recyclable materials are processed annually at the Metrolina Recycling Center. Yard trimmings are recycled to produce high quality compost and mulch that are available for sale at Compost Central.  All compost meets the US Composting Council Seal of Testing Assurance Program requirements.

### About the Data
Tonnage of residential recycled waste and yard waste collected from the City of Charlotte for the fiscal year from eligible households, divided by the total tonnage of residential solid waste collected from eligible households. Residential solid waste includes garbage, recycling, yard waste and non-recyclable bulky items. The data include single family residential units (attached and detached), multi-family buildings with fewer than 30 units, and any additional legacy multi-family buildings serviced by the City of Charlotte. Towns in Mecklenburg County are not included because solid waste data are not collected at the neighborhood level.
