## Adopt-a-Stream Participation
Percentage of eligible streams adopted for clean-up

### Why is this important?
Neighborhoods, businesses, individuals and organizations can make a difference in their community by adopting a stream and committing to two clean-ups a year - walking the stream channel, picking up litter and reporting water pollution. Stream clean-up events are an effective way to improve water quality, wildlife habitat and aesthetics, and promote stormwater awareness and pollution prevention. Working together to clean up streams can also promote community building and participation in neighborhood events.

#### How are we doing?
Each year, more than 1,200 volunteers remove over 9 tons of trash from local creeks and streams. 

#### Did you know?
There are eleven volunteer programs relating to water quality available to residents of Mecklenburg County - you can volunteer a couple hours a year, make a long-term commitment to your neighborhood stream or groundwater aquifer, or simply take the time to report unusual stream conditions.

### About the Data
The length of stream banks maintained by the adopt-a-stream program divided by the total length of stream banks. 

The data do not include shoreline along the Catawba River. For areas where a stream forms a boundary, the linear feet of adopted stream bank is attributed equally to both Neighborhood Profile Areas.
