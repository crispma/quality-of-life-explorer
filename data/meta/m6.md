## Housing Size
Average heated living space of single-family housing units 

### Why is this important?
Houses have been steadily increasing in size over many decades as living standards and norms have changed and incomes have risen. Average housing size may be an indicator of affordability, as larger houses tend to be more expensive to own/rent and maintain, and may also be used to assess environmental impacts. As housing size increases, more resources are used in construction, more land is occupied, more energy consumption is increased, tree canopy may diminish along with increases in impervious surfaces and stormwater runoff. Increases in average housing size may indicate new construction on previously undeveloped land, or indicate in-fill or redevelopment in an older neighborhood with smaller houses. The trend towards larger houses can impact both the character and affordability of older neighborhoods during periods of revitalization and reinvestment.  

#### How are we doing?
The average size of single-family houses in Mecklenburg County has increased 84 square feet since 2011, continuing a long-term trend. Nationwide, the average size of single-family houses has increased nearly 600 square feet in 30 years, even as the average household size (occupants) has declined.

#### Did you know? 
According to research in *The Appraisal Journal*, the size of a home relative to the average sized home in a neighborhood may affect its sales price. Homes that were smaller than the average home sold at an average 4.7% premium.
