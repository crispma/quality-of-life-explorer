## Housing Code Violations
Housing-related code violations per 100 units

### Why is this important?
Housing code regulations help ensure that residents are not affected by substandard residential buildings. Structures that do not meet minimum housing code must achieve compliance through the housing code process. Housing inspections are initiatied by petitions, complaints, or field observations and may include infractions from broken windows to irreparable structural problems. Maintaining housing structures helps keep occupants and neighborhood residents safe from harm and may reduce the likelihood of vandalism or crime.
