## Residential Foreclosures
Percentage of dwellings that were foreclosed

### Why is this important?
Foreclosures can be found in all neighborhoods and cities and can be destabilizing for neighborhoods and families. Homes that are foreclosed on and are not sold or otherwise re-occupied can result in vacancies, economic disinvestment, and physical deterioration. Concentrations of foreclosed homes in an area may affect property values, tax receipts and public service delivery, vandalism and crime rates, and social cohesion. People and families, too, are impacted by foreclosures, as the loss of a home, whether owned or rented, can lead to displacement, stress, and more financial strain. 

#### How are we doing?
According to the North Carolina Court System, the number of foreclosure *filings* in Mecklenburg County has deacreased every year from 2010 to 2016, and is now seeing the lowest number of filings since 2002.

#### Did you know?
According to analysis from CoreLogic, 3.7% of home mortgages in the Charlotte metropolitan area were considered Seriously Delinquent (three monthly payments or more past due or in foreclosure) as of October 2014. Nationally, the total number of completed foreclosures declined every month between 2011 and 2014.

### About the Data
Number of single-family dwellings, condominiums and townhome foreclosures divided by the number of single-family dwellings, condominiums and townhomes for the fiscal year. 

Foreclosures are identified by the Sales Code of "FC" in Sale History. Loans in default and foreclosure filings that are in process are not included.
