## Adopt-a-Street Participation

### Why is this important?
Neighborhoods, businesses, individuals and organizations can make a difference in their community by adopting a city street and committing to three clean-ups a year - picking up litter, marking storm drains, reporting graffiti and removing illegal signs. Litter can reduce the value of real estate, deter a customer from entering a business or a new employer from locating to a community, and cause damage to water quality and wildlife. Maintaining order by picking up litter or removing graffiti can encourage others to "follow the rules" and may increase community safety. Working together to clean up streets can also promote community building and participation in neighborhood events.

#### How are we doing?
There was an increase of 237 miles of adopted streets from 2017 to 2021. Nearly 1,100 miles of city streets are cleaned twice a year by an army of dedicated volunteers. They remove almost 1,000 bags - about 17,700 pounds - of trash each year from Charlotte streets. The most frequently littered items are cigarette butts, food remnants, and food wrappers.

#### Did you know?
The presence of litter in a neighborhood decreases property values by about 7%, according to a pricing model from the National Association of Home Builders. When trash and pollutants are washed into storm drains, it flows into waterways and is distributed into streams, rivers, lakes, and oceans. This harms wildlife and degrades their habitats. According to the Global Conservation Force, eighty percent of marine pollution can be traced back to sources on land.

### About the Data
Number of miles of city-maintained streets adopted for litter clean up divided by the total mileage of city-maintained streets. 

Note: State-maintained roads adopted through the state's Adopt-A-Highway program and private roads are not included in this variable.
