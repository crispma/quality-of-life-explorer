## Proximity to Public Outdoor Recreation
Percentage of housing units within &#189;-mile of an outdoor public recreation area

### Why is this important?
Recreational facilities provide opportunities for physical activity and social interaction, both key components of good physical and mental health. Increased physical activity is associated with lower risks of type 2 diabetes, cancer, stroke, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and premature mortality, independent of obesity. Research suggests that people who live closer to sidewalks, parks, and gyms are more likely to exercise. In a growing region like Charlotte-Mecklenburg, protecting land set aside for outdoor recreation is important to maintaining access to recreation opportunities and the community's engagement with nature and the outdoors.

#### How are we doing?
Overall, 58.4% of housing units in Mecklenburg County were within 1/2 mile to a public outdoor recreation in 2020. Mecklenburg County has approximately 21,000 acres of park land, consisting of 210 parks and facilities, averaging 20.2 acres of parkland per 1,000 residents. The rate of access to recreational facilities is 16 per 100,000, higher than the 11 per 100,000 statewide and the same as 16 per 100,000 nationally. Mecklenburg County has nearly every type of recreational amenity imaginable including:  250 athletic fields, 240 miles of trails, 149 tennis courts, 109 basketball courts, 16 community gardens, 14 fishing piers, 6 dog parks, 5 golf courses, and 3 senior centers.

#### Did you know?
In 2020, according to The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 33.6% of people in North Carolina were medically obese and 24.6% classified as physically inactive. Being outside in green spaces supports an active and healthy lifestyle, which increases life expectancy, improves sleep quality, and reduce cancer risk.
