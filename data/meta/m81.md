## Public Health Insurance
Percentage of the population who receive Medicaid or N.C. Health Choice

### Why is this important?
Public health insurance for income-eligible individuals and families is provided through Medicaid or the North Carolina Health Choice Plan (NCHC). Medicaid provides health coverage for income-eligible individuals and families, while North Carolina State Children's Health Choice is a program that provides health care for income-eligible children that do not qualify for Medicaid and who are not insured through a private health care provider. High or increasing numbers of public health insurance recipients may be connected to other issues such as access to health care providers and usually reflects high unemployment or policy changes which expand eligibility.

**Note**: There is no update available for this dataset at this time. This variable is important to measuring the Quality of Life, therefore the older data will remain accessible until a reliable source becomes available. 

### About the Data
Population receiving Medicaid or NC Health Choice divided by the total population. Areas with fewer than 5 Medicaid and NC Health Choice recipients are suppressed and represented as N/A. 

Note: Data for this variable for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA) level are derived using individual address-level records that must be precisely located to exact addresses. It is not uncommon to have 1% to 4% of records not able to be included due to record formatting errors or the addition and subtractions of streets and housing units.
