## Residential Demolitions
Concentration of residential demolitions

### Why is this important?
Residential demolitions are an indicator of changes in housing stock. Demolitions can occur due to a structure not meeting minimum housing requirements, due to a change in property use, or due to a new owner intending on rebuilding a newer home.  

#### Did you know?
The number of single-family demolitions in Mecklenburg County has increased from fewer than 100 per year in fiscal year 2011 to more than 400 annually for the last three years.
