## High Speed Internet Access
High Speed Internet Access

### Why is this important?
According to the Brookings Institute [Metropolitan Infrastructure Initiative](https://www.brookings.edu/series/metropolitan-infrastructure-initiative/), high speed internet adoption, or broadband, can help deliver health, economic prosperity, and equity to all communities. Broadband also has the potential to create happier, healthier, and more resilient societies. First, as an educational tool, broadband enables people to learn new skills to solve challenges; it allows them to learn more about their health to better manage conditions from home; and it can inform them about local issues, helping create tighter-knit communities. As a recreational tool, broadband increases and democratizes entertainment options, giving people more choice and freedom in how they spend their time. It also democratizes information, allowing people to access new ideas, information, and resources. And as a social networking tool, broadband makes it easier to maintain and connect with loose or physically distant social ties, helping people maintain a broader sense of community. Lastly, research shows that broadband adoption increases civic engagement. Broadband reduces barriers to attaining information and interacting with local representatives, it increases the likelihood of voters voting, contributing to campaigns, and contacting their local representatives.

#### How are we doing?
Nearly ten percent of households in Mecklenburg County or about 110,000 people have no internet access at all and 24.8% don't have broadband access. Broadband is an essential amenity, but the cost of service is a major barrier. This lack of access has disproportionately affected some communities more than others. Broadband access is highly correlated to a variety of demographic and economic factors, particularly income and race. Data from the Pew Research Center shows that as of 2021, 92% of adults making greater than $75,000 per year had access to high-speed internet, compared to just 57% of those who earned less than $30,000 per year. Along the lines of race and ethnicity, 80% of white adults have reliable high-speed internet access, compared to just 71% of Black adults and 65% of Hispanic adults.


Note: In order to make equal comparisons to the smaller areas, the values for Mecklenburg County, North Carolina and the United States in the previous paragraph are also from the American Community Survey 5-Year estimates. While more current 1-year estimates are available for the larger areas, it is important to use the most precise and most comparable 5-year estimates. Due to margins of error, the county-wide calculated sum of NPA values may not align with the county value.

#### Did you know?
Currently, there are more than 307 million internet users in the United States, nearly 91% of the population. Email is the most popular digital activity among internet users and the most frequent way people access digital media is on their smart phone. The demographic distribution of broadband access is also closely related to geography. Rural areas lag far behind urban and suburban communities in access to reliable high-speed internet. And rural areas with a higher population of racial and ethnic minorities and lower income levels, such as in southern states like Mississippi, Arkansas, and Alabama, are the locations most likely to lack high-speed internet access. At the metro level, many economically distressed communities in the South and the Rust Belt region are among the least likely to have high-speed internet available.


### About the Data
High Speed Internet Access is estimated in the American Community Survey (ACS).

The U.S. Census Bureau defines high speed internet adoption is anything faster than dial-up.
